<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--    
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is not a tag or element in HTML; rather, it is a document type declaration
(DTD) that specifies the document type and version of HTML being used.
Its primary purpose is to inform the browser about the version of HTML in which the web page is written.
This declaration is placed at the very beginning of an HTML document.
--
For HTML5 documents, <!DOCTYPE html> is used, as HTML5 does not require a more complex DTD.
 It is a simplified and standardized way to declare the document type.

<html>
<!--
The <html> element is a fundamental element in Hypertext Markup Language that serves as the root or container for the entire HTML document.
It is typically the outermost element, encapsulating all the content on the web page.
The <html> element contains two main sections: the <head> section and the <body> section.
